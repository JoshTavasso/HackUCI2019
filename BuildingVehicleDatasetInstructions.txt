Instructions on how to get the updated vehicle related incident data set:
1. Export csv file of all police incidents from https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Calls-for-Service/hz9m-tj6z.
2. Put csv file into project folder and rename to "calls.csv".
3. Run "python3 buildDataSet.py".
4. Vehicle related incident data set will be stored in "vehicles.csv".
5. Remove "calls.csv" because it is a very large file. :)
